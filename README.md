# sales_dashboard
Hi everyone ğŸ‘‹ 

Using Power BI, I've transformed raw sales data into actionable insights, and created interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data.

I have used different types of customized visualization ( bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers  etc ).
